To run the lexer and the parser:

1. Compile lexer.c as follows:
	gcc lexer.c -o lexer

2. Compile parser.c as follows:
	gcc parser.c -o parser

3. Run the lexer file, with the Rust program as a command-line argument:
	Example:
	./lexer TestCases/hello.rs

4. After running the lexer, run the parser:
	./parser

Ouput will be printed to the console including the stack trace. The rules and the productions are present in the 
rules.txt file.
